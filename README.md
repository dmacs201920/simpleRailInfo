Sai ram,
Here my project is about to make similar like as IRCTC app.
 Mainly my project works on searching trains from Visakhapatnam, Bangalore and Bhubaneshwar stations to remaining places in the country. 
Here there is a feature called tourism where the Indian railways started them long back where you can enjoy your trip in a luxurious way.
 You can reserve a ticket from one place to another place from the three stations.
Here IRCTC app provides meals on wheels where you can order food also. Finally, I tried to make similar way as IRCTC looks.
